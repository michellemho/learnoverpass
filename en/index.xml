      <title>Way Node Recursion</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“Oh! I see that building!” Bob exclaims. “So the ATM is just on the other side, yes?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Bob walked to the building, he realized one important thing - he didn’t know where the entrance is! Looks like we need to write another query for him!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the existing query, we’ve successfully found the building, but we need to further locate a specific point - the building’s entrance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A building, since it’s generally a polygon when viewed from the map, is defined as a &lt;code&gt;way&lt;/code&gt;. However, an entrance is usually just one point in the map - a point with a specific location. So how do you think they are represented in Overpass? If you’ve guessed by &lt;code&gt;node&lt;/code&gt;s, then you’ve guessed right!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember when I told you that &lt;code&gt;way&lt;/code&gt;s are just defined as an ordered list of nodes? Some of these nodes can be further tagged, taking different values such as entrances. In the next query, we’ll learn how to query for a specific node (an entrance) that is part of a &lt;code&gt;way&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“Hmm, I don’t see it from the observatory, but I do see it from the overpass query map.” says Bob. Indeed, the ATM is on the opposite side of a building (the brownish polygon in the map viewer).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s go ahead and query for both ATM and the building, so that Bob can have a better idea as to where the ATM is.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“Thanks man!” Bob says as we query for the route back again. He follows it to reach the observatory tower. Once he reached the river bank, he decides to leave his bike and &lt;em&gt;swim&lt;/em&gt; to the observatory!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few minutes, Bob comes back, shivering and wet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Brrrr… water’s cold!” Bob exclaims, when, out of nowhere, the waiter from the restaurant, all in white attire, appareas. He actually followed Bob all this way!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sir” the waiter says, panting “I still need that 25 euroes!”. “Yeah, surely” Bob says as he grabbed his wet wallet from his pocket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh” a deadpan expression comes from him. “Sorry, it seemed that I lost all my money swimming back here!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waiter: &lt;em&gt;Facepalm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So there are quite a few Bushwick Avenues in the world. It looks like there&amp;rsquo;s at least three in Long Island and even one in New Jersey. Let&amp;rsquo;s limit the search area to just New York City. Areas are kind of funny in OSM. You can read more about it here: &lt;a href=&#34;http://michellemho.github.io/learnoverpass/en/docs/filters/area/&#34;&gt;http://michellemho.github.io/learnoverpass/en/docs/filters/area/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, we&amp;rsquo;re going to limit the area search not with a bounding box or an &amp;ldquo;around&amp;rdquo; filter, but with an area filter. First, we need to find areas with the name &amp;ldquo;New York City&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hooray! You found CARTO Brooklyn!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like Sally needs to walk down Bushwick Avenue to get here. Let&amp;rsquo;s put that on the Overpass map for her too. You should know all the steps to find and visualize a street (aka way) named &amp;lsquo;Bushwick Avenue&amp;rsquo; by now!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I still don&amp;rsquo;t know where I need to go!&amp;rdquo; Sally wails. Why is there still no CARTO in Brooklyn? Sally is very sure this building should exist. And so do we because we&amp;rsquo;re sitting inside it right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the &amp;ldquo;Data&amp;rdquo; view of our results right now. We see the three cafe nodes printed out (Dun-Well Doughnuts, Jessie&amp;rsquo;s Bakery, and Bread Brothers). But what about the way? It looks like a list of node ids. We need to change the output method to get these points on the map!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Huh&amp;hellip; so it looks like CARTO is in Madrid! Sally is very worried that she misread the MeetUp and accidentally went to CARTO Brooklyn instead of CARTO Madrid. But wait! This is where we learn that there are things other than &lt;strong&gt;nodes&lt;/strong&gt; that exist in OpenStreetMap. Obviously, there are polygons and lines too! In OSM-speak, these are called &lt;strong&gt;ways&lt;/strong&gt;. A way is essentially an ordered list of nodes that make up linear features like roads, rivers, etc. A closed way (where the first and last node is the same) is a polygon and can represent building footprints, parks, regions, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, OSM has &lt;strong&gt;relations&lt;/strong&gt; which is a data structure describing a relationship. For example, if you have a building with a hole in it (like a courtyard), a single &lt;strong&gt;way&lt;/strong&gt; can&amp;rsquo;t represent this. A relation that represents this complex multipolygon needs to be used instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lucky for us, CARTO Brooklyn is a pretty regular looking rectangular building. Let&amp;rsquo;s look for a &lt;strong&gt;way&lt;/strong&gt; with the name CARTO!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Great, you found three cafes! Sally heads into Dunwell Doughnuts to end the rumblings in her stomach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s recap what we&amp;rsquo;ve learned so far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Query for nodes (aka points) in areas using both bounding boxes and &lt;code&gt;(around:n)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Filter by &lt;code&gt;[key=value]&lt;/code&gt; tags&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use regular expressions to find non-exact tag values&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chain together multiple query statements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s now time we figured out where CARTO is!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nice! It looks like Sally is standing by the Citibike station outside the Montrose (L) station. Sally is really late for CartoCamp, but now she says she&amp;rsquo;s getting a hungry and could use a snack&amp;hellip; Can you help her find a cafe nearby? She&amp;rsquo;s feeling pretty lazy too, she doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to walk far! What are her options?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Oh no, nothing was found! Is Sally wrong? She says she definitely sees a Citibike station. It turns out that we can&amp;rsquo;t put these filter statements together because we&amp;rsquo;re not looking for a node that is tagged as both a railway station AND a Citibike station. We&amp;rsquo;re looking for a second node that is &lt;strong&gt;around&lt;/strong&gt; the first one. In Overpass, queries are chained together &amp;ndash; output from a first query will flow as input into the next query.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before, we queried for nodes in an &lt;em&gt;area&lt;/em&gt; (the bounding box). Now, we&amp;rsquo;re going to look for nodes within a new area &lt;em&gt;around&lt;/em&gt; the two nodes we found. Let&amp;rsquo;s use the Overpass function &lt;strong&gt;around&lt;/strong&gt; to search for Citibike stations nearby Montrose and Morgan.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Great! We&amp;rsquo;ve narrowed it down to two subway stations&amp;ndash; Montrose and Morgan stations. Sally just texted us again and she says she sees a Citibike station nearby. Another clue!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Okay! We found a few subway stations that Sally might be at. And Sally just remembered that the name of the subway stop started with &amp;ldquo;Mo&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; but she can&amp;rsquo;t remember the rest. Oh, Sally! Can we use this information to help figure out which station Sally is at? Let&amp;rsquo;s find names of nodes that start with the letters &amp;ldquo;Mo&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overpass supports a form of &lt;strong&gt;regular expressions&lt;/strong&gt; that can help us search for non-exact tag values. Let&amp;rsquo;s use &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; in a filter statement.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Whoa! That&amp;rsquo;s a lot of nodes. Which one is Sally at? She now says she just exited a subway station&amp;hellip; Click around on the nodes. You&amp;rsquo;ll see that all of them have coordinates, but some have additional information in &lt;strong&gt;tags&lt;/strong&gt;. Let&amp;rsquo;s filter by tags to figure out which subway station Sally might be at.&lt;/p&gt;
