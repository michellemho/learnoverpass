code: |
  node(40.69734,-73.947387,40.708564,-73.931457)[railway=station][name~'^Mo'][amenity=bicycle_rental];
  out;
instructions: |
    1. Remove the bicycle_rental tag filter, but keep the semicolon which ends our first statement
    2. Start a new query statement for new nodes in the second line (`node`)
    3. An **around** filter follows the format `(around:n)`, where n is a distance in meters. For input, it looks at whatever is in the existing *"set"*, which are the nodes for Montrose and Morgan from the previous query statement.  Let's try looking within 50 meters, because Sally says the Citibike station is very near.
    4. Now add the tag for Citibike station after the area filter. Remember, the appropriate tag is `[amenity=bicycle_rental]`. Tag filters come in brackets whereas area filters are in parenthesis.

hint: Make sure to end your second line with a semicolon!

Oh no, nothing was found! Is Sally wrong? She says she definitely sees a Citibike station. It turns out that we can't put these filter statements together because we're not looking for a node that is tagged as both a railway station AND a Citibike station. We're looking for a second node that is **around** the first one. In Overpass, queries are chained together -- output from a first query will flow as input into the next query.

Before, we queried for nodes in an _area_ (the bounding box). Now, we're going to look for nodes within a new area _around_ the two nodes we found. Let's use the Overpass function **around** to search for Citibike stations nearby Montrose and Morgan.
