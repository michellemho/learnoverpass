    1. In OSM, all tags follow the format of a `[key=value]` pair. By convention, subway stations are tagged with the pair `[railway=station]`.
    2. Append this key-value pair to the end of the node query statement, but before the semicolon. You can think of semicolons as periods that end statements.
    3. Run the query.

hint: Make sure you're just adding the filter and not changing anything else.

Whoa! That's a lot of nodes. Which one is Sally at? She now says she just exited a subway station... Click around on the nodes. You'll see that all of them have coordinates, but some have additional information in **tags**. Let's filter by tags to figure out which subway station Sally might be at.
