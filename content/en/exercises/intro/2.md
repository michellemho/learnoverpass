    node(40.69734,-73.947387,40.708564,-73.931457);

    1. In OSM, all tags follow the format of a `[key=value]` pair. By convention, subway stations are tagged with the pair `[railway=station]`.
    2. Append this key-value pair to the end of the node query statement, but before the semicolon. You can think of semicolons as periods that end statements.
    3. Run the query.

hint: Make sure you're just adding the filter and not changing anything else.

Whoa! That's a lot of nodes. Which one is Sally at? She now says she just exited a subway station... Click around on the nodes. You'll see that all of them have coordinates, but some have additional information in **tags**. Let's filter by tags to figure out which subway station Sally might be at.

Those circles you see in the map view are "points of interest" called “nodes”. Try clicking on them - some just contain their own positions (lat/lon) but some of them are tagged and contain other data, such as names, type of node, etc, etc.

Since our friend “Bob” has a pretty inaccurate GPS, he only managed to give us rough coordinates. He DID say that he would be by a tree, however, so why don’t we try searching for a node that’s a tree? He’s bound to be there!
