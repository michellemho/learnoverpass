Okay-- we found all the bike shares that are Citi Bike or Hubway in Boston and New York City. You'll notice that some bike stations are missing. Obviously, the new stations that have been installed recently haven't been added yet, or they may have been tagged differently. Feel free to check out `out meta` to see when this dataset was last updated.
