Huh... so it looks like CARTO is in Madrid! Sally is very worried that she misread the MeetUp and accidentally went to CARTO Brooklyn instead of CARTO Madrid. But wait! This is where we learn that there are things other than **nodes** that exist in OpenStreetMap. Obviously, there are polygons and lines too! In OSM-speak, these are called **ways**. A way is essentially an ordered list of nodes that make up linear features like roads, rivers, etc. A closed way (where the first and last node is the same) is a polygon and can represent building footprints, parks, regions, etc.

Finally, OSM has **relations** which is a data structure describing a relationship. For example, if you have a building with a hole in it (like a courtyard), a single **way** can't represent this. A relation that represents this complex multipolygon needs to be used instead.

Lucky for us, CARTO Brooklyn is a pretty regular looking rectangular building. Let's look for a **way** with the name CARTO!
