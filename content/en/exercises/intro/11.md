    1. Keep the query as it looks currently, but add another line after line 6.
    2. Areas can also be tag filtered. Look for areas with `area[name='New York City'];`
    3. In line 8, filter the way query with `(area)`.
hint: Filter for ways within the search area with `way(area)`

So there are quite a few Bushwick Avenues in the world. It looks like there's at least three in Long Island and even one in New Jersey. Let's limit the search area to just New York City. Areas are kind of funny in OSM. You can read more about it [here] (http://michellemho.github.io/learnoverpass/en/docs/filters/area/).

We've learned limit the search search  with a bounding box and an "around" filter already, but now we will use an area filter. First, we need to find areas with the name "New York City".
