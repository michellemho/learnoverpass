So there are quite a few Bushwick Avenues in the world. It looks like there's at least three in Long Island and even one in New Jersey. Let's limit the search area to just New York City. Areas are kind of funny in OSM. You can read more about it here: http://michellemho.github.io/learnoverpass/en/docs/filters/area/.

For now, we're going to limit the area search not with a bounding box or an "around" filter, but with an area filter. First, we need to find areas with the name "New York City".
