  node(40.69734,-73.947387,40.708564,-73.931457)[railway=station][name~'^Mo'];

    1. It's now time we figured out where CARTO is.
    2. But let's keep the last `out;` statement and start a new query underneath in line 5
    3. Search for nodes named CARTO. Remember to use another `out;` statement to "print" the results. Because we're using two `out;` statements here, we expect to see our three cafes and the location for CARTO after running the query.

hint: The search is `node[name='CARTO']` with a semicolon and a second out statement!

  node(around:100)[amenity=cafe];
  out;
  node[name='CARTO'];

Great, you found three cafes! Sally heads into Dunwell Doughnuts to end the rumblings in her stomach.

Let's recap what we've learned so far:

1. Query for nodes (aka points) in areas using both bounding boxes and `(around:n)`
2. Filter by `[key=value]` tags
3. Use regular expressions to find non-exact tag values
4. Chain together multiple query statements
