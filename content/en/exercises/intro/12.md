section: "exercise"
code: |
  (area; area)->.my_set;
  node;
  out;
instructions: |
    1. We need to union two `area` statements for both `name="New York City"` and `name="Boston"` in the first line
    2. Let's keep this query only for nodes with the tag `amenity=bicycle_rental`. Remember to apply an area filter to this node query as well!
    3. Use a regular `out;` to print the results. Because we're only looking for nodes, this should work fine.
    4. To be even more precise, add another union and tag filter for nodes that belong to the `[network="Citi Bike"]` or `[network="Hubway"]` in line 2.
hint: Line 2 should look like `(node(area.my_set)[k=v];node(area.my_set)[k=v]);`
answer: |
  (area[name="New York City"];area[name='Boston'])->.a;
  (node(area.a)[amenity=bicycle_rental][network="Citi Bike"];
   node(area.a)[amenity=bicycle_rental][network="Hubway"]);
  out;

Awesome! We now have a decent map of where CARTO is. We have a chain of queries using different search area methods. There were three outputs -the cafes, CARTO Brooklyn, and Bushwick Avenue.

Let's leave Sally because we think she can find her way to CARTO now. I've cleared the map. Let's build a query to look for bicycle rental nodes in both Boston and New York.

Now we're going to learn how to group statements together.
A **union** allows you to group the results of several queries.

`(statement_1; statement_2; â€¦)->.result_set;`

and is written as a pair of parentheses. Inside the union, any sequence of statements can be placed.
