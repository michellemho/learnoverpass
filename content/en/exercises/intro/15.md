Wow! That was great work so far. Let's recap what we've learned:

1. Query within areas using bounding boxes, `(around:n)`, and areas.
2. Filter by `[key=value]` tags
3. Use regular expressions to find non-exact tag values
4. Query for nodes, ways, and relations
5. Chain together multiple query statements
6. Union multiple query statements
7. Change the output format of results
8. Count results
9. Create a for loop

Wow. That was a lot. Challenge Question time! Can you find all the schools and parks in New York City that are within 50 meters of each other?
