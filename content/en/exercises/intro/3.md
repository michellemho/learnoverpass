    1. Add another tag filter right after the one for subway stations. Remember, tag filters are in brackets.
    2. We're looking for the `name` of a subway station, so the tag key will be `name` and we should use `^` because we're looking for a substring at the beginning
    4. The tag should look like ``[name~'^Mo']``. This query is case-sensitive, so be careful with the capitalization! Though you could use regular expressions to make the query case insensitive... Read more about Overpass flavor of regex [here](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Overpass_QL#Value_matches_regular_expression_.28.7E.2C_.21.7E.29).

hint: Is your filter in brackets? Do you have the ~ and ^ symbols? Capitalization matters!

Okay! We found a few subway stations that Sally might be at. And Sally just remembered that the name of the subway stop started with "Mo..." but she can't remember the rest. Oh, Sally! Can we use this information to help figure out which station Sally is at? Let's find names of nodes that start with the letters "Mo".

Overpass supports a form of **regular expressions** that can help us search for non-exact tag values. Let's use `~` instead of `=` in a filter statement.
