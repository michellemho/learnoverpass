    1. Citibike stations are tagged as `[amenity=bicycle_rental]`
    2. But how do we look for nodes around other nodes?
    3. Can we simply append this tag to the end of our first query statement like we did before? Let's try.

hint: Is your filter in brackets? Do you have end with a semicolon?

Great! We've narrowed it down to two subway stations-- Montrose and Morgan stations. Sally just texted us again and she says she sees a Citibike station nearby. Another clue!
