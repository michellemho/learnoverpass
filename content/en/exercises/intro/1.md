    1. Let's help our friend Sally get to CartoCamp.
      ![Sally](https://ca.slack-edge.com/T024FUQQ8-U04UJEMGW-da321f539184-72)
      She's a little lost, but she thinks she's somewhere in the vicinity of CARTO. We'll use a **bounding box** to estimate where she is. To search for nodes within a bounding box, we follow the format:
            ```
              node(SW latitude,
                   SW longitude,
                   NE latitude,
                   NE longitude);
            ```
    2. Change the node query to look within this bounding box:
      - Bottom left corner: 40.69734,-73.947387
      - Top right corner: 40.708564,-73.931457

    3. Run the query, it should look like `node(40.69734,-73.947387,
         40.708564,-73.931457);`

hint: Did you end with a semicolon and keep the ending out statement?

    node(40.69734,-73.947387,40.708564,-73.931457);
    out;

Welcome to CartoCamp! Today we're going to learn how to use OpenStreetMap's [Overpass API](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API). Overpass is an awesome tool for serving up custom selected parts of OSM. This CartoCamp workshop is an introduction to the query language of Overpass and how you can use it to get shapes for your mapping projects!

On the right is a text editor where you can type in your query commands. See the statement with the words `node` and `out`? That's a query statement which asks the API to output a single point of interest (in OSM-speak, a point is a node).

The world map below shows the results of your query. You can also toggle the raw data view by clicking the Data button. Right now, the map contains nothing, because our statement is incomplete -- we are asking for a node, but the API doesnât know which node! In fact, there were exactly 3,772,704,127 nodes in OSM when I checked this week at
[OSM Stats](http://www.openstreetmap.org/stats/data_stats.html).
