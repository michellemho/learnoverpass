"I still don't know where I need to go!" Sally wails. Why is there still no CARTO in Brooklyn? Sally is very sure this building should exist. And so do we because we're sitting inside it right now.

Check out the "Data" view of our results right now. We see the three cafe nodes printed out (Dun-Well Doughnuts, Jessie's Bakery, and Bread Brothers). But what about the way? It looks like a list of node ids. We need to change the output method to get these points on the map!
