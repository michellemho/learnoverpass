Nice! It looks like Sally is standing by the Citibike station outside the Montrose (L) station. Sally is really late for CartoCamp, but now she says she's getting a hungry and could use a snack... Can you help her find a cafe nearby? She's feeling pretty lazy too, she doesn't want to walk far! What are her options?
