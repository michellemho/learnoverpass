instructions: |
    1. In line 1, the setting `[out:csv(::"type",::"id", name, ::"count")];` makes the output a csv. The fields starting with `::` indicate an OSM special field.
    2. In line 2, we're searching for an area. Go ahead and fill out "New York City"
    3. In line 3, we're looking for the counties within our search area. US counties in OSM are relations tagged as `admin_level=6`. Fill in that line
    4. In line 4, we're using `map_to_area`, which is a funky function. It's taking all the relations we found in the line above (the counties) and creating search areas out of them
    5. In line 5, we're adding a `foreach` loop. The prefix `.d` tells the loop to assign the loop results into this new set `.d`
    6. Line 6 is simply printing out the results we currently have. Since we haven't done anything yet, this will simply return the counties we found.
    7. In line 7, we're looking for the nodes within these areas now. Fill in the `bicycle_rental` for the tag.
    8. Finally, we'll simply print out the count of these nodes and close the loop! Let's run it.
hint: Make sure to use parenthesis and close statements with semicolons.

Wonderful! You found 471 bikeshares in Boston and New York City. Now, hold on to your hats, because we're going to introduce a whole bunch of concepts here. We're going to count the number of Citi Bike stations in each New York City county. For this, we'll need to use a new function `map_to_area`, look for relations, and create a `foreach` loop. For good measure, we'll also output the results as a csv!
